# Tremaux-s-Maze-Solving-Algorithm-
My implementation of Tremaux's Algorithm for a Maze Solving LEJOS Robot. Works for grid-based mazes.

Junctions are points where other paths ,eet the current path in use.
Paths are the lines in which the robot will follow between two junctions. All paths must be of equal length.
Takes 3 boolean values as input, returns integer.

This code was used in a first year project where I helped design a maze solving robot which used a LEJOS system.
The robot was a line-following robot however the code can be implemented anywhere.
Currently written in java 1.7 to support the LEJOS library when being used with code which accesses this library.
